## Installation
Fork and clone this repo from Github. `cd` into the main directory using your console and run `bundle install` to install all Gem dependencies.

## Writing Code
You should write all your code for your domains in file in the `app/models` directory. You can create a file for each model in your domain.

## Testing Your Code
We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. Write all your code in the `app` folder so that it is loaded into the environment. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb`. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here.


# Instructions

- Create three models comprising a many-to-many relationship.  Choose a domain that is of interest to you and your partner--have fun with it!  Do you have a shared hobby?  Favorite TV show or movie?  

- Before you type *anything*:
    - Sketch out your domain, including listing any foreign keys
    - List the methods you will build.  Aim for about 4-5 per model
        - at least one class method besides `.all`
        - we can help brainstorm if you get stuck--just ask

- **TEST YOUR CODE!!!**  Code a little, test a little.  You should never have to wonder whether or not something works.  You should KNOW and be able to PROVE it to someone else (can be as simple as running the method in a pry / console and verifying it does what you want it to do)

- If you finish early, think about adding more methods or an additional related model!  We can help come up with ideas for that as well.
